# Water_Hardness_Detection
We present a sensor that combines two well known concepts of 
colorimetry and complexometric to detect water hardness. Our 
sensor uses LEDs, Photodiodes and Voltmeter/Galvanometer. When 
a light is passed through a homogeneous coloured solution the 
solute in the homogeneous mixture absorbs some light i.e., 
absorbance. The absorbance is directly proportional to the 
concentration of solute.

# Aim
A new sensor design for detecting water hardness using colorimetric 
concepts.

# Conclusion
The device minimizes the energy 
consumption and man- power involved in the measurement of 
the hardness of water.The device is easy to produce at low 
costs and has the potential to provide profitable business 
opportunities. This device is capable of 
performing hardness check on the water even when the water 
is flowing which was not possible with the earlier models as 
they required water to be static in nature. Due to this it can 
easily be installed in homes.The device provides quick and near to accurate 
results minimizing the time required in the process.
